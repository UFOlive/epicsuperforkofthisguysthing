## Getting Started
This project is a Bomberman clone built with vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS as part of the Ironhack Web Development bootcamp. The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. You can also [click here](https://danielcspaiva.github.io/Bomberman-Clone/) to check it out!

## Installing

Clone or download this repository. Run the index.html and let me know what you think.

## Instructions

You control a character that places bombs that explode after a short time and can kill the enemies. Enemies will spawn in random locations, wander around and give you damage if they touch you, so avoid them and try to kill them with your bombs.

Everytime you kill an enemie there is an 80% chance of it dropping a power up. There are three Power-ups that can increase your bomb capacity, bomb reach and player speed.

On single player mode your goal is to kill as many enemies as possible. On multiplayer mode your goal is to defeat the other player. 

The controls are as follows:

Player 1:
* Move: Arrow keys.
* Place Bomb: Spacebar.

Player 1:
* Move: a, w, s, d.
* Place Bomb: q.
