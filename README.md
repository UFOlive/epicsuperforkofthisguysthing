This project is also deployed at https://danielcspaiva.github.io/Bomberman-Clone/ and available to play.

## Installing

Clone or download this repository. Run the index.html and let me know what you think.

## Instructions

The game has two different modes, single player and multi player. Enemies will spawn in random locations, place bombs so you can kill them.

There are three Power-ups that can increase your bomb capacity, bomb reach and player speed. Everytime you kill an enemie there is an 80% chance of it dropping a power up. On multi player mode your goal is to defeat the other player. 

The controls are as follows:

Player 1:
* Move: Arrow keys
* Place Bomb: Spacebar

Player 1:
* Move: a, w, s, d
* Place Bomb: q
